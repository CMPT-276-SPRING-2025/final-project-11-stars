## Description:

**üå±BrainGoated** is an interactive educational trivia quiz platform designed for children aged 8‚Äì16, offering fun and engaging quizzes across a variety of topics and difficulty levels. It addresses the challenge of keeping young learners engaged by turning traditional study into a playful, curiosity-driven experience. Designed with accessibility in mind, it allows users to explore subjects like Science, History, and Sports by selecting quiz type (image or text), difficulty, and language‚Äîpowered by The Trivia API. For deeper personalization, users can also create their own quizzes by entering a topic of their choice, with questions dynamically generated using the OpenAI API.

What makes BrainGoated stand out is its AI-powered learning layer. After each question, students receive a fun fact to deepen their understanding. They can also chat with Bud-E, the built-in AI assistant, to ask follow-up questions and explore topics at their own pace.

With support for multiple languages, dark/light mode, confetti celebrations, and mobile responsiveness, BrainGoated makes learning enjoyable whether at home or in the classroom.
